Why does everybody talk about the importance of having a budget?

**Budget is nothing but a creative plan to manage your money in the coming future.**

But have you ever been able to accurately budget your finances ? Let me tell you that it is quite difficult to keep track of every little expense and hence most of you give up on the budget idea itself.  

You would have heard so many different techniques of making a budget. I am here to simplify some of the budgeting methods for you to decide the most relevant one for your financial needs.

**1. The Money Freedom budget**:

I call it *“The Money Freedom”* budget since I always follow this method.

A savings oriented budget is focussed on maximizing savings while keeping expenses under control.
- **Step 1 :** You simply need to determine your life goals and lifestyle as a first step.
- **Step 2 :** Now determine X% of savings for your life goals and transfer it from your income portion to a separate account.
- **Step 3 :** The balance portion of your Income can be spent for living expenses and your wants.

You can start with 80/20. This method is as simple as it sounds – save 20% and spend 80% of your total income. The way to use this method is to transfer the 20% savings immediately in a different account and then spend the balance 80% on everything else.

The beauty of this budget is that it does not force you to think too much or track every little detail. You can always push yourself to achieve 70/30 or 60/40 or even a 50/50 ratio going forward.  

This approach will always ensure that you pay yourself first (Savings) and thus keep you on track to reach financial freedom.

**2. The Envelope Method**:

This method is for you if you end up over-spending money without even realizing. It will make you more disciplined since you need to use cash to spend money instead of digital card.

**How this works ?**

- **Step 1:** Label envelopes with different categories.
- **Step 2:** Just figure out how much you spend on each category every month such as food, transportation, going out with friends/family, shopping etc.
- **Step 3:** Now pay your rent/mortgage and bills from your income.
- **Step 4:** Then take out the leftover in CASH and divide it between your envelopes.
- **Step 5:** Only spend out of the designated envelope for each category. So, if you’re going to the supermarket – take the Food envelope with you.
- **Step 6:** Don’t ‘borrow’ money from other envelopes. Once an envelope is empty, you need to stop spending in that category.

In this way, you are forced to plan accurately for each envelope. Using cash while shopping will stop you from overspending on ‘extras’ since you no longer have the ease of swiping your card.

**3. Goals-Driven Budget**:

This budget is goal oriented. It aims to break the habit of impulse spending and debt based spending. It is for people who want to spend or buy something without putting any thought on the usefulness but later regret when they have to repay the debt.

**How it works ?**

- **Step 1:** Choose one goal. It could be a new sports bike or car or a vacation. Now figure out the total cost.
- **Step 2:** List your cash flow – inflow and outflow keeping the goal in mind.
- **Step 3:** Now try to figure out how much you can contribute to this goal every month. This could mean giving up some non-essential expense (coffees, eating out, movie theatre) to direct money towards this goal.
- **Step 4:** You may open a separate account to transfer amount for this goal every month. This could make you more determined to follow the budget without getting into unnecessary debt since you own that goal completely.

This method is not for someone who is under lot of debt. If you have debt repayments then please focus on repaying it instead of creating any new goal. You need to come out of deficit first.

**4. Category based budget**:
This method involves allocating specific portion of your income towards each category. There are different styles as follows :

**A. 50-30-20 budget**:

This method was developed by Harvard bankruptcy expert Elizabeth Warren. It is meant for people with a steady and consistent income stream. Since there is certainty of income it is easy to divide the income into 3 parts for every month.

**Income portion**	 

- **50%**	To be spent on “Needs” such as food, electricity, rent, insurance etc.
- **30%**	To be spent on “Wants” like entertainment, shopping, vacation etc.
- **20%**	To be saved for “Financial goals” like Savings and Debt repayment

The idea is to spend a fixed amount of income for needs and wants and save a fixed portion of income. This method is not meant for people with inconsistent income. If you have a consistent income and don’t want to spend time in tracking for all your activities then simply divide your income in 3 categories and use it based on the requirement.

The benefit of this method is when you face an emergency or need to save aggressively for a life goal then you can always reduce your wants from 30% to 10% while simultaneously increase savings from 20% to even up to 40%.

**B. The 60% solution**:

This budgeting system created by former MSN Money’s Editor-in-chief, Richard Jenkins.

He suggests to spend **60% of a household’s gross income (before taxes)** on fixed expenses. Fixed expenses includes food, clothing, regular bills, taxes, insurance, car and house debt repayments.

The other **40% income** breakdown is as follows :

- **10% Retirement :** Money set aside for retirement
- **10% Savings:** Money set aside for car purchases, House renovation or to pay down substantial debt loads. This includes emergency expense.
- **10% Irregular expenses:** The money in this category is used for things such as vacations, irregular expenses, and other bigger expenses.
- **10% Fun money:** Money set aside for entertainment purposes.

If an individual has a high amount of non-mortgage debt, Jenkins advises that the 20% apportioned to Retirement and Savings be directed towards paying off debt; once the debt is paid off, the 20% (Retirement + Savings) is to be immediately redirected back into the original categories.

This method is for you if you like to automate money management without too much analysis.

**C. 5-Category Budget**:

The following five-category budget recommended by Jean Chatzky allows you to break down your spending into five categories.

- **35% Housing =** You must not spend beyond 35 percent of your take-home income. This includes every housing-related expense
- **15% Transportation =** Transportation expenses must take up no more than 15 percent of your take-home income. This includes everything from parking to repairs and maintenance expense.
- **25% Other Living Expenses =** Other living expenses, which are predominantly discretionary expenses, should take up 25 percent of your income. This includes recreational activities such as eating at restaurants, buying concert tickets, buying new clothes, going to sporting events, and family vacation.
- **10% Savings =** Your savings are predominantly for an emergency fund, retirement, and investments for life goals.
- **15% Debt Payoff =** Debt Payoff should consume 15 percent of your income. This includes your credit cards or student loans. It does not include your mortgage payment or car payment, which are listed under “housing” and “transportation.”

Now you are better equipped to make your own budget.
