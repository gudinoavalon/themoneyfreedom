Enough people including me have highlighted the importance of savings in your financial freedom journey. But do you know that by simply saving money you will never reach your goals in the desired way. Saving money is not a one time activity ; its a continous process that needs to happen as you generate income. Now as you keep saving money it keeps getting accumulated but it never grows. Investing is a process to grow your money to achieve desired results. The results could be profits, dividend, capital gains, interest, rent etc. The results of investing gets added to the investment amount and grows your money.

# Do I really need to grow my money ?
# Investing will take away money from my hands
# I don't know where to invest
# I don't have enough money to invest
# Investing is risky
# I will invest later

These are some of the statements we hear from people who never invest their money. Instead of pointing out the benefits of investing, let me ask you a question, Do you know what you might lose by not investing ?

1.Inflation can erode your progress
How often do you hear about inflation. What is it? How does it affect us? Inflation simply is the reduction in the value of money. How is that possible? Due to Inflation, purchasing power of your money decreases. If petrol costed Rs.80 a litre, then with inflation of 5% ; the same quantity of petrol will cost you Rs.84 a litre.
Your savings are losing power if they are simply kept idle. By investing your savings, you are able to grow your money to either keep pace with inflation or to earn beyond inflation.

2. Miss out on Life goals at different stages of your life
Life is ever changing and ever evolving. At every stage of life we have different priorities, different needs and different expectations from others. Each stage is a new experience – from a kid to teenager to young adult to newly married adult to young parent to an old person. Life goals keep evolving from getting a job/starting a business to buying a house to child’s education to child’s marriage to old age retirement. Nobody will fulfil these goals for you since they involve considerable amount of money.
By investing money from an early age, you will be able to contribute towards the achievement of your life goals. You may debate on the need for investing money in so much advance by giving up so many things that you could enjoy. That could be true but always remember that when you reach the various stages of life it will become nearly impossible to accomplish these financial goals. The disappointment caused due to failure of financial goals can negatively impact your emotional well-being and personal relationships.
For example :
- Not being able to buy a house in your lifetime can be frustrating.
- Not being able to afford your child’s education or their marriage can be very disappointing.
- Not being able to enjoy your retirement after working for so long can be a life-time regret.

3. Fail to reap benefits of Compounding
Continuously earning, saving and investing money is a process that can make you wealthy. But for how long can you keep doing it? Can you employ someone to do it for you? Yes this is absolutely possible. That someone is “Money” itself. Money can create more money for you. If you adopt compounding as a principle of investing your money from an early age or adopt it at any age but continue doing it for a very long time then it has the potential to make you wealthy. Rich people make money work for themselves by employing money to create more money.  
You can grow your money by investing it to earn returns on your investment. Now if you invest your money along with the returns earned on it then this is called as Compounding. You keep adding returns on the original investment and keep re-investing it.
For Example : If you invest Rs.5000 at 10% interest then it becomes Rs.5500. Invest Rs.5500 at 10% and it becomes Rs.6050. Invest Rs.6050 at 10% to make it Rs.6655 and so in.
This is the power of compounding !	You can multiply your benefits with “Time” – either invest for a long period of time or start investing as early as possible.

4. Achieve Freedom in life
Investments simply ensure more financial resources at your disposal. Just having more financial muscle can give you the power to make radical decisions in life. Investments have the power to pull you out from the daily rat race of 9 to 5 job. The power of your investments can help you start your own business.
I have explained in detail as to why we get into debt? Not having any investment goal leaves space for going off-track with your money and may also land you into debt. As described in my article – Do you understand the world of Insurance?, life will bring ups and downs. Investments can strengthen you to withstand unfortunate events. After reaching the middle era of your life, when major life goals will stare you in the eye, your investments can provide peace of mind from the worry about “what-ifs of life”.

To conclude my thoughts on Investments, I can say that it will give you the freedom to live life on your own terms. Do you want to get pushed in life or Do you want to live it on your own terms? Make a decision today!
