What does one need to do for achieving Financial freedom in life?

There is no ready-made path designed for it since each of us face unique problems in life. But there is something which is most definitely required; its called Financial literacy. Financial literacy is the knowledge of dealing with money to make intelligent decisions for better financial health.

> ### There is a secret psychology of money. Most people don’t know about it. That’s why most people never become financially successful. A lack of money is not the problem; it is merely a symptom of what’s going on inside of you.”

-T. Harv Eker

Unfortunately, schools and colleges never teach anything about money. They punish you for making mistakes which is why you become so risk-averse in life. The sad reality is that people lack even the basic skills to work in real-life situations at a corporate job or profession or starting a business or investing money. This is captured perfectly by Robert Kiyosaki, author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad” where he emphasizes so much on gaining financial education. I highly recommend you to read this book.

We have learned to get a degree and find a job that helps us pay the bills. While we are making money from a 9 to 5 job we never think beyond managing our day to day living expenses. Investments for crucial life goals are not a priority for most people.

A lot of people today complete their education through a student education loan which forces them to look for job security. This will help you pay bills but never make you financially independent. This is where financial literacy makes a difference. Those who understand the money game will never lose it while those who are indifferent to this game will continue struggling throughout their life. Sadly, we never get a chance to learn this game either at school or at home.

We need to understand that our Boss is not responsible to make us rich. Boss is responsible to give us a monthly salary on time. We need to improve money management skills and budget our income to create investments for our freedom. Most people never bother to invest because they feel it is too risky or they don’t know how and where to invest.

Investment is the most important skill you should develop to achieve financial freedom. The amount of work to earn a living has limitations but money has the potential to work even when you are sleeping. You need financial education to make money work for you instead of you working for money.

> ### An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.”

– Benjamin Franklin

We are driven by opinions rather than hard facts when it comes to money. We hear statements like “Buy your house on EMI”, “Always buy a new car instead of a second-hand car”, “Term life insurance is an expense”, “Mutual funds are risky”, “Credit card is money freely available for buying” etc. All these opinions have been formed over the years by people who have struggled financially.

Have we ever done our own calculation on whether to buy a house on loan or upfront payment, buying a new car on loan or second hand car with cash, Investing in mutual funds or Bank Fixed deposits, term life insurance or any other insurance product like endowment/money back/ULIP, dangers of credit card and advantages of debit card ? Our financial situation is a direct product of our thinking. We have conveniently agreed with these opinions without even debating or looking for answers. This habit is worse than getting trapped in debt for a lifetime.

Most surveys indicate that financial literacy is poor in India. Standard & Poor survey from 2014 found that over 76 percent of adults in India didn’t comprehend financial planning basics. The financial decisions made by Indians are a result of opinions passed on by previous generations. Hence, financial education alone will not solve the problem.

Before investing money, start investing in yourself by becoming financially educated. Financial education will generate the highest return on investment for you. Learn the rules of the game of money if you want to win it.

I will help you to change your outlook towards money by not only educating you to make better decisions but also providing you different perspectives on behavioral finance. Keep reading upcoming articles to increase your knowledge to reach financial freedom faster.
