The way you treat your income is more important than your actual income. Your financial success depends on the way you manage money after earning it. There are lottery winners who become overnight rich but struggle for survival after a few years of winning that lottery. Why do they end up so badly after reaching an extraordinary level of financial strength? The answer is very simple – its the attitude towards managing money that leads to their downfall.

How do you treat your income? Do you go out shopping on the same day? Do you arrange for a weekend party immediately? Do you buy a new smartphone? Do you go out for dinner with friends? These things are important in life since you have worked hard to afford it.

― Edmond Mbiaka

I have always believed that less income is not a problem for our struggle with money. Bad money management is the problem. I don’t think spending money is bad. The point I am making is that you are paying everyone else except yourself. You need to pay yourself first !!! There can’t be any justification for not paying yourself first.

Income earned should be utilized to pay yourself first. This is called “SAVINGS”. Always remember your life is an expense until you are alive on this planet because there are no free lunches available. Savings should become a habit since you will need money as you progress through different stages of life. Your idea of achieving financial independence is directly proportional to the percentage of savings done from your income.

> ### Do not save what is left after spending; instead spend what is left after saving.”
― Warren Buffett

If you keep paying others first then you will slowly become a customer for them. This helps them achieve their dreams, not yours. But if you are determined to achieve your dreams then you should pay yourself first and move one step closer to your target. There is no end to wants and luxury but you need to choose between spending for pleasure today or saving for a rainy day.

I am not asking you to give up the necessary things in life nor am I asking you to become deadly serious about life. I am asking you to cut back on expenses that are not relevant to you in the larger scheme of life. Initially, it will be uncomfortable but the next time you will get habitual to it. By doing this you will manage to decrease your expenses and increase the savings rate. For example, you can invite friends to dinner at home instead of going to a restaurant. This will give you the option to develop deeper relationships at a much lower cost.

In your student life, you had limited money to spend; so you invented innovative ways to enjoy life. If you live like a student in your post-marriage adulthood then you can shoot your savings rate better than your peers. This approach will go a long way in helping you build wealth for bigger milestones later like buying a house, starting your own business, child’s education, child’s marriage, medical expenses, retirement years, travel, etc. But living like a student does not mean sacrificing to the point of becoming unhappy and giving up the idea of savings.

You can start by saving 10% of your income. If you do it for a few months you will notice that you have surplus money which will motivate you to save more. Now you can increase your savings rate to 20%-25% and then aim to reach 50% in the future.

By increasing your savings rate you are forcing yourself to think creatively in reducing your expenses. Of course, this will invite some sharp criticism from a few people in your circle but it will make sense in the long run. You need to choose between pleasing your circle and moving towards your dream. Remember that when you are in trouble nobody except your own money will help. Banks also give loans to people who are capable of repaying with interest.

Your ability to maximize your savings and minimize your living expenses will help you the most on this journey. But some people will disagree with saving for tomorrow since they believe in living life to the fullest today without caring too much for the future. I will share my perspective to answer people who disagree with the importance of savings in my next article.
