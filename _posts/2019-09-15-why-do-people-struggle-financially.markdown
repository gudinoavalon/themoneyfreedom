People who struggle throughout life blame wrong things for their poor state. We are where we are not because of external reasons but because of our actions and decisions.

I will decode the reasons for our financial struggle today.

<h5>Adopting lifestyle of others</h5>
The world is becoming materialistic. It measures the worth of an individual based on the possessions one has. Thus we tend to follow the lifestyle of others who look good in society. We don't even think whether it makes sense for us to adopt such a lifestyle. Do we need an even bigger house than the current one? Should we buy a new car because our existing car looks old now? Do we need that latest version of a smartphone?

The urge to follow the latest trends leads to actions without much thought. We fail to understand that there is a difference between feeling rich and becoming rich. Can we not think through and then make decisions related to money ?

> ### Never spend your money before you have earned it.”
– Thomas Jefferson

<h5>Not paying yourself first</h5>
Most people are ready to spend even before they have earned an income. The habit of Savings is not very common today. Savings means paying yourself first. It means keeping your focus on future needs without giving up present happiness. The ideal pattern is Earn-Save-Spend but when you Earn-Spend-Save then it’s a bad action which will soon become a bad habit. This bad habit will land you into new trouble called – Debt !!! The reason I say so is that your focus is on consumption and not on wealth creation. Once you are into debt, you lose track from your financial freedom journey. I will write a separate article on debt soon.

<h5>No budget</h5>
We see people living paycheck to paycheck because they don’t know where the money is flowing. Not budgeting your income and expense is the reason for limited financial control. Without creating a budget you cannot have control over your expenses. The budget creates a discipline and forces you to do only those things that are part of the plan.

<h5>Low Investments</h5>
Only saving money without putting it to productive use does not help much. Investments enable achievement of life goals at every stage. Your decision to keep money idle is riskier than investing it because it lost the chance for growth. Money has the unique ability to create more of it when invested in the right place. Hence it is vital to create investments to reach financial independence faster.

<h5>Too much debt</h5>
Debt has destroyed families across the world. Debt is nothing but money borrowed from elsewhere that needs to be repaid on time. People get into debt because of a sudden medical emergency, higher education or wedding. These expenses can force you to borrow money if you don't have enough of it. But money borrowed for fulfilling wants is not wise. Needs and emergencies are not avoidable but wants are avoidable.

<h5>Financially uneducated</h5>
You struggle with money not because of low income but because of bad money management. This is because your education is only for employment and not about money. Not investing time in financial education leads to bad decision making with money. There are many ways to live even with less income if you have financial sense.

Now that you know the reasons for your financial struggle you are in a better position to come out of it. You are better equipped to avoid the mistakes that you have made in the past. Today, resolve to give up those habits that landed you in trouble.
