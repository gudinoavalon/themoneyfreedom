What is that one advice you have heard the most related to money ? Spend less and save more to become financially secure. If it is so simple then why do people struggle so much ?

Can you follow this saying ? Honestly, I don’t believe in it. Have you seen Mark Zuckerberg, Founder of Facebook or Steve Jobs, Founder of Apple ? What is that one common element in these people ? They wear the same outfit everyday to avoid Decision Fatigue. The success of these individuals cannot be measured by the shoes or clothes they wear.

“I really want to clear my life to make it so that I have to make as few decisions as possible about anything except how to best serve this community” Zuckerberg said, after clarifying that he had “multiple same shirts.”

“If you make too many decisions in too short a time frame, you significantly reduce your decision-making ability,” Steve Jobs said. He famously wore the same black turtleneck, blue jeans and New Balance sneakers every day.

**I want to share a few strategies with you to dramatically improve your spending habits.**

- **Delayed spending** means delaying an expense for a few days and then deciding if it really makes sense to spend money on it.

For example – Gym membership costs you Rs.24,000 annually and Rs.2500 monthly. Past trend says that you never continue gym workouts after 3-4 months. In the excitement of workout you would have paid Rs.24,000 for yearly membership but actually used it for only 4 months. Now if you delay the membership idea and spend sometime to think practically then monthly membership for 4 months will cost you only Rs.10,000 which means you have avoided an unnecessary expense of Rs.14,000.

- **30-Day Rule** to control impulse spending.

Whenever you feel the urge to spend — whether it’s for new clothes, a new smart phone, or a new gadget — force yourself to stop. If you already own that item then try to leave the store. After you come back home make a note of it in your mind or on paper or your cell phone with the name of the item and the price. For the next 30 days, don’t buy it but keep thinking whether you really need it. At the end of 30 days, if you still feel the urge then buy it. There is a chance that you don’t feel strongly about it anymore which means you can live without it.

- **Savings will secure your life goals in**
1. Liquid fund (easy to withdraw in short term)
2. Long term Investments (with some risk but high return potential).
<br>

- **Expenses are divided into Needs and Wants in 2 different accounts**
1. Your Needs such as food, electricity, daily commute, house rent etc. are fixed expenses which can remain in your **Primary bank a/c** or withdrawn in cash for spending.
2. Your Wants such as movies, restaurant, socialize outside, shopping etc. can be transferred to your **Secondary bank a/c** since they are variable expenses which may or may not happen.

Using 2 different accounts for expenses creates a limit to spending money. Its like a pre-decided amount available for you to fulfill your needs and wants. With limited resources available, you will be conservative in your choice to spend money. If allocated money is exhausted then wait until next month until re-allocation is done for Expenses.

By doing this exercise every month you will be able to gain control of your money in a much better way.

You must be wondering that people may call you cheap if you suddenly change your spending pattern. But I want you to be frugal, not cheap. Ramit Sethi in his book “I will teach you to be Rich” has given an excellent analysis for Cheap and Frugal.

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>CHEAP</th>
	<th>FRUGAL</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1. Cheap people care about the cost of something.</td>
    <td>1. Frugal people care about the value of something.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2. Cheap people try to get the lowest price on everything.</td>
    <td>2. Frugal people try to get the lowest price on most things, but are willing to spend on items they really care about.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>3. Cheap people's cheapness affects those around them.</td>
    <td>3. Frugal people's frugality affects only them.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>4. Cheap people make you feel uncomfortable by their behaviour and way of thinking.</td>
    <td>4. Frugal people make you feel uncomfortable because you realize you could be doing better with your money.</td>
  </tr>
