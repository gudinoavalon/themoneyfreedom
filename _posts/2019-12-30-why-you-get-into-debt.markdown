In India, our ancestors always said that “the worst form of inheritance for anybody is debt”. You get into debt when you borrow money to purchase things. Anything purchased through debt is borrowed ownership. Since you do not own the money used in buying the stuff, you need to repay debt first and then claim ownership.

It is vital to remain debt free in life since debt can derail you from your objective of achieving financial independence.

**Let us try to understand the reasons for getting into debt.**

<h5>Living beyond your means</h5>
Leading a lifestyle that your income cannot support is like inviting debt. If you are spending more than you are earning then it causes an imbalance in your overall finance. Our culture has promoted that buying new stuff is good and that could easily cause mindless spending. It is quite easy to get lured by the latest purchase offers, discounts, and easy EMI options. If you cannot afford something it is better to stay away rather than borrow debt. Not following a debt-free approach will land you into financial trouble.

<h5>Following the lifestyle of others</h5>
If you are constantly comparing your lifestyle with those around you then you will get into a never-ending race. There is no guarantee that the people you are following are making sound financial decisions. Following them could not only lead you into debt but also bankruptcy. Do what is important in your life. Make sensible decisions with money.

<h5>Bargain hunting for fun</h5>
You are under the impression that you are saving money on the latest offer or discount at the retail store. But if this was not in your shopping list then it was an unnecessary purchase. This would drive you to spend beyond your planned budget and negatively impact your savings.

<h5>Failing to budget</h5>
A budget serves as a guideline while dealing with your income. Failing to budget is like failing in your finances. Since you have no idea about where your money goes you are unable to make productive use of it. Hence when the need arises, the only option left with you is to borrow

<h5>Marital disharmony</h5>
The cycle starts with expensive weddings wherein a huge amount of money is spent on stuff that adds little value to developing relationships. Your spouse should be on the same page with you on the topic of money. If couples do not share the same vision about their future and do not make financial decisions together then it could create a tricky situation. Post marriage it is not “my” money, it is “our” money.

<h5>Student education loan</h5>
In the pursuit of a flourishing career, you may go for higher education. But higher education requires a lot of money. If your parents had not saved for it in advance then the only option available apart from selling an asset is to apply for a student education loan. Banks are ready to finance higher education if it can lead to a high paying job in the future since such a borrower will be able to repay the bank loan comfortably. There is always an option to reduce some burden by doing any job and saving money before beginning your higher education.

<h5>Life changes</h5>
Life is always unpredictable. Certain events push us behind by several years in life. For example, the loss of a family member can cause emotional damage to us. If the family member was an earning member then the impact could be even harsher on your family. Reduced income could also be due to a loss in business or the loss of a job. You fall behind on your payments with any reduced income and hence you are forced to borrow money to follow your lifestyle.

<h5>Medical Expenses</h5>
Sudden emergency or disease could lead to hospitalization or expensive medical treatment. Healthcare costs will increase in the coming days. If you do not have health insurance, you will have to spend money from your pocket which could derail you from your financial plan. Not having saved for an emergency would lead to borrowing money.

<h5>Lack of emergency fund</h5>
We face financial emergencies such as job loss, a serious medical condition, accidents or calamities. An Emergency fund helps in facing challenges that life throws at you. Unfortunately, most of you are not prepared for any such emergency and hence rely on borrowed money. Your regular income is insufficient in dealing with such emergencies and hence an Emergency fund created with little savings every month can help you in troubled times.
