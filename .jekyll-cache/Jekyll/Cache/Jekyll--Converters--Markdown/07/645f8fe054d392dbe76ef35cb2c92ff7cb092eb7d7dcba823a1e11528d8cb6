I"•<p>Life is beautiful and we should always hope for the best to happen. But is it possible that only good things will happen to us in life? Nature always creates a balance with good and bad. Insurance is a tool to protect us from unfortunate events of life. Insurance is a way of ensuring that when things run out of our control, we can get back on our feet at least from a financial point of view.</p>

<p>You must be wondering as to how is that possible? Insurance is a legal contract between you and the Insurance company. This legal contract protects you when any unforeseen event occurs such as death, hospitalization, fire, earthquake, theft, accident, etc. The Insurance company charges you <strong>‚ÄúPremium‚Äù</strong> and agrees to take the risk of such negative events by compensating you for a pre-decided amount called <strong>‚ÄúSum Assured‚Äù.</strong></p>

<p>Insurance is a business where Insurance company does a risk assessment of the Insured and determines the probability of a negative event. Based on this assessment it decides to charge money to the Insured for undertaking the risk. Normally the amount of premium is much less than the ‚ÄúSum Assured‚Äù. This is possible because a lot of people or objects are insured at the same time. Based on probability and some statistic calculations, it is clear that not all negative events will occur at the same time. Hence Insurance companies have to pay <strong>‚ÄúClaims‚Äù</strong> for limited risk while they collect Premiums from everyone they insure.</p>

<p><strong>Insurance policy</strong> is a promise made by Insurance company in writing to the insured (Individual or Object) for compensation in case of an unfortunate event.</p>

<p><strong>For example :</strong>
The insurance company collects Rs.5000 (Could be more or less based on risk) as premium from 10,00,000 people. Total Premium collected is Rs.500 crores. Let us assume Mr.Sharma had purchased life insurance of Rs.25,00,000 for Rs.5000 premium. Now as and when any unfortunate event occurs to those 10,00,000 people, the Insurance company pays claim to that person from Rs.500 crores collected as premium. In the case of Mr.Sharma‚Äôs death, the Insurance company pays Rs.25,00,000 to the nominee of Mr.Sharma as mentioned in the Insurance policy.</p>

<p><strong>Insurance business model:</strong></p>

<p>The Insurance company makes a <strong>profit; if Premium collected &gt; Claims paid</strong>
Example : Premium (500 crores) ‚Äì Claims (300 crores) = <strong>Profit (200 crores)</strong></p>

<p>while it makes a <strong>loss; if Premium collected &lt; Claims paid.</strong>
Example : Premium (500 crores) ‚Äì Claims (600 crores) = <strong>Loss (100 crores)</strong></p>

<p>To make a profit, the Insurance company needs to assess risk as much accurately as possible. This is called <strong>‚ÄúUnderwriting‚Äù.</strong> There are underwriters in every Insurance company responsible for risk assessment and premium calculation. Insurance companies consider various factors while charging Premium to the Insurance policyholder. If underwriting is done well then the chances of making a profit increase.</p>
