I"o<p>I welcome you on this journey with me to reach Financial independence. I am a traveler on this route moving towards my freedom. The reason I embarked on this journey is that I wanted to do things that make me happy from within. What do you think is more valuable – money or time? Why? Money beyond a point will not make you happy. You can be happy with little money or miserable with a lot of money.</p>

<p>For me, time is more important because life is way bigger than we imagine it to be. Life is not about chasing money. It is about living those dreams we had in our childhood and things that we always wanted to do.</p>

<p>You would not want to get stuck in a job that you hate but continue doing for the sake of paying your bills. You would love to pursue your hobbies even if it meant limited or no income at all. You would love to travel with your family and friends to explore the beautiful places on earth. To do all this you need to reach a point where you are no longer ruled by the lack of money.</p>

<p>The reason you are here is that you are curious about money and the freedom it can give you in your life. It is time to take control of your life rather than get affected by circumstances and reach nowhere. This journey will push you to make some tough decisions with your money habits. This won’t be pleasant at the start but will be worth it at the end.</p>

<p>I will not give you quick tips to become rich or get wealth. I will share different perspectives to provoke you to think about the subject of money.</p>

<p>Get prepared to change your life by embarking on this journey with me.</p>
