I"®<p>There are 2 schools of thought in this world when it comes to money ‚Äì enjoy the snow today or save for rainy days. Both viewpoints are correct for people who adopt them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3 id="a-man-who-both-spends-and-saves-money-is-the-happiest-man-because-he-has-both-enjoyments">A man who both spends and saves money is the happiest man, because he has both enjoyments.‚Äù</h3>
</blockquote>

<p>‚Äì Samuel Johnson</p>

<p>With all the talk around the importance of savings, the counter view is to enjoy every minute of life without thinking too much into the future.</p>

<p>Life today is easier than in the previous century. Around 100 years back, human beings worked at least 10 times more than today due to limited resources. With modern inventions, things started becoming easier for us such as‚Äì easy transport, smart homes, instant communication, fancy clothing, a variety of food. We have been heavily marketed to live an ideal life that convinced us to keep buying things to achieve that lifestyle.</p>

<p>How could consumerism occupy so much space? The answer lies in our weakness of emulating the lifestyle of those around us to keep pace with the trend. It was a trap that we needed a big brand new car, the big house with an attached garden, the credit card for shopping, the latest fashion clothing, exotic vacations, weekend beach parties, latest electronic gadgets and many more. With so many to-dos in the wish list, we worked hard to earn money and afford that kind of lifestyle.</p>

<p>Every new trend demanded more income and hence more working hours which kept taking away our freedom. Now after working so hard we felt entitled to buy the stuff as a reward for the hard work done to earn money.</p>

<p>Do things bring happiness to us? Studies have shown that fulfilling relationships bring more happiness than any other thing. Are we investing time in buying things or building relationships? People feel that living life to the fullest without focussing too much on saving money is the best way to invest in relationships. This is because a savings mindset makes you look selfish in the eyes of others. But people will adjust to your way of life after a point of time if you can keep peer pressure away. With a frugal lifestyle, you are saving for a rainy day when you need your money the most.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3 id="dont-tell-me-where-your-priorities-are-show-me-where-you-spend-your-money-and-ill-tell-you-what-they-are">Don‚Äôt tell me where your priorities are. Show me where you spend your money and I‚Äôll tell you what they are.‚Äù</h3>
</blockquote>

<p>‚Äì James W. Frick</p>

<p>Now proponents of spending money will argue that in the pursuit of saving for rainy days, they need to sacrifice their present lifestyle. Spending can be either for things like smartphones, shoes, clothes, etc or experiences like a small vacation with loved ones and reconnecting with old friends over a weekend trip. Spending on things will give you short term pleasure but spending on experiences will provide everlasting memories. You need to make a choice here.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3 id="everyone-needs-to-strive-for-financial-freedom-so-that-he-or-she-can-focus-on-what-heshe-loves-in-life">Everyone needs to strive for financial freedom so that he or she can focus on what he/she loves in life.‚Äù</h3>

<p>This is best captured in the concept called F.I.R.E which stands for Financial Independence Retire Early. FIRE is a community of people who believe in winning the most scarce resource ‚Äì Time; through aggressive savings and low-cost investments. FIRE enables you to retire early to do the things that make you happy.</p>

<p>Early retirement does not mean that you spend your life on the beach reading a newspaper and drinking beer. You reach financial freedom in a sense that you no longer work to earn a livelihood but you live a life full of passion. You could spend time learning music or painting or photography or anything since you have enough income to sustain your entire life without worrying about it.</p>

<p>The basic thought is to do anything other than sitting on your desk and waiting for the clock to hit 5 pm before heading home. FIRE is about listening to your inner calling to do things that you love doing.</p>

<p>FIRE is gaining a lot of acceptance in the western world. There is a community of enthusiasts who are believers and followers of FIRE.</p>

<p>Let me know what do you think about FIRE.</p>
