I" <p>When we talk about financial education, its difficult to understand the starting point. Since you are curious about financial education, you should start with Accounting. Many people, especially from non-finance background, have heard of myths about accounting.</p>

<p>Let me tell you that accounting is nothing but common sense and pure logic in the field of finance and money. There are jargons difficult to understand but easy to learn. You have come across ‚Äúbudgeting‚Äù as a tool to gain control of your finances. The foundation of a budget is accounting. Without accounting, you cannot create and follow a successful budget.</p>

<p>Accounting means to account for something. Now, this could be only 2 things ‚Äì money coming in(Cash inflow) and money going out(Cash outflow).</p>

<p>The impact of any financial decision creates only two results for you ‚Äì <strong>‚ÄúIncome‚Äù</strong> and <strong>‚ÄúExpense‚Äù</strong>.</p>

<p>Anything that creates income is an <strong>‚ÄúAsset‚Äù</strong>.</p>

<p>Anything that leads to an expense is a <strong>‚ÄúLiability‚Äù</strong></p>

<p>To calculate your Net Worth, please make a total of your assets and liabilities.
<strong>Net Worth = Total Assets - Total Liabilities</strong></p>

<p>Let me explain with a case example of Avalon who wants to know his Net worth.</p>

<p><em>Financial Summary</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>House worth Rs. 90,00,000</li>
  <li>Car (Sale value) Rs.5,50,000  (Total EMI pending worth Rs.4,20,000)</li>
  <li>Bike (sale value) valued at Rs.70,000</li>
  <li>Gold worth Rs.7,00,000</li>
  <li>Bank FD worth Rs.1,00,000</li>
  <li>Mutual funds valued at Rs.2,80,000</li>
  <li>Student Education loan dues of Rs.6,10,000</li>
  <li>Credit card bills of Rs.2,00,000</li>
  <li>Outstanding expenses are Rs.1,70,000</li>
  <li>Equity Shares worth Rs.1,00,000</li>
  <li>Savings bank a/c balance is Rs.35,000</li>
  <li>Provident fund of Rs.1,40,000</li>
  <li>Life insurance of Rs.40 lacs and premium Rs.8,000</li>
  <li>Health insurance of Rs.5 lacs and premium Rs.12,000.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now let us categorize the above under Assets and Liabilities :</p>

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Assets</th>
    <th>Amount(Rs.)</th>
    <th>Liabilities</th>
	<th>Amount(Rs.)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bike</td>
    <td> 70,000</td>
    <td>Student Education loan</td>
	<td>6,10,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Gold</td>
    <td>7,00,000</td>
    <td>Credit card</td>
	<td>2,00,000</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Bank FD</td>
    <td>1,00,000</td>
    <td>Outstanding bills</td>
	<td>1,70,000</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Mutual fund</td>
    <td>2,80,000</td>
    <td>Car loan</td>

  </tr>
<tr>
    <th>Total Assets</th>
    <th>14,25,000</th>
    <th>Total Liabilities</th>
	<th>14,00,000</th>
  </tr>

<p>Key Observations:</p>

<p><strong>1. House is not an asset</strong></p>

<p>If Avalon is living in the house then it cannot be treated as an Asset since it is not generating any income for him. In fact the house would demand repairs and maintenance expense. Thus it would fall under liabilities. But if he owns a house that has been leased to someone then it becomes an asset that generates rental income.</p>

<p><strong>2. The resale value of the car is not an asset. Car loan is a liability</strong></p>

<p>Since he has purchased the car with the help of a bank loan, he becomes liable to repay it. Until the loan is repaid, the ownership of the car remains with the bank and hence cannot be sold by him. Hence, Avalon needs to acquire ownership of the car by repaying the loan first. The car can be sold once the loan is settled.</p>

<p>But car will always be a depreciating asset. Its value starts declining with each passing day. I will address this in a seperate article to give you detailed insights.</p>

<p><strong>3. Life and Health insurance - Neither Asset nor Liability</strong></p>

<p>The insurance Sum assured amount cannot be an asset since it will come into picture only when an incident like illness leading to hospitalization or death happens.</p>

<p><strong>4. Insurance premium is an expense</strong></p>

<p>If both the incidents ‚Äì death or hospitalization do not occur then it is a pure expense for Avalon in the form of premium. The idea behind paying the premium is to protect him from hospitalization expenses if his health worsens. In case of his death, his dependants get compensated by Insurance company since he has paid a premium to cover his loss of life.</p>

<p>As per my explaination above, Insurance premium treated as an expense does not mean Insurance is a liability. I will explain further in a seperate article on Insurance.</p>

<p>Let us calculate his Net worth now :</p>

<p>Net Worth = <strong>Total assets [14,25,000]  ‚Äì  Total Liabilities [14,00,000]</strong></p>

<p><strong>Net Worth = Rs.25,000</strong></p>

<p>In this case, the Net worth of Avalon is positive since Assets are more than Liabilities.</p>

<p><strong>Positive Net worth = Total Assets &gt; Total Liabilities</strong></p>

<p>Positive Net worth shows that you are on the right path to reach Financial independence. As the gap between Asset and Liability increases positively, it proves that you are gaining financial muscle.</p>

<p><strong>Negative Net worth = Total Liabilities &gt; Total Assets</strong></p>

<p>There is a chance that Net worth could be negative which happens when Liabilities are more than Assets. This is a dangerous situation because what you own in the form of Assets are not sufficient to pay off your Liabilities.</p>

<p>Now, you have all the required knowledge to make your Personal Balance sheet to figure out your Net Worth. While this exercise can be done any number of times, I recommend you to do this at least once in a year. It helps in creating a realistic budget.</p>
